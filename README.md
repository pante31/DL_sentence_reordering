# Deep Learning: Sentence Reordering

This project was created for the _Deep Learning_ (DL) exam as part of the **Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence** at the **University of Bologna**.
It involves designing a Neural Network with specific constraints on parameters to tackle the _Sentence Reordering_ task.
Detailed instructions for completing the project are provided in the notebook, so feel free to explore it if you're interested.
